**Key Learning Points:**

* **Bottom App Bar Navigation:** Implementing a bottom navigation bar for a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to switch between different sections of the app.
* **Navigation through Bottom Nav Bar:** Understanding the logic behind how each tap on a bottom navigation item triggers a navigation action, changing the content displayed on the screen.
* **Model Schemas:** Defining data structures using model classes to organize and structure the data within the app, which leads to better maintainability.
* **Datasets:** Handling and using predefined datasets to populate the app with relevant information (e.g., workout data).
* **Get Current Date using `intl` Flutter Package:** Leveraging the `intl` package to display formatted dates and handle time-related functionalities in a user-friendly manner.
* **Google Font Package:** Incorporating Google Fonts to enhance the visual appeal and personality of the app through custom font styles.
* **Media Queries:** Adapting the app's layout based on screen sizes to ensure responsiveness on different devices, which is crucial for a consistent user experience.
* **Grid Class and `GridBuilder`:** Implementing grid layouts using the `Grid` class and creating dynamic grids using the `GridBuilder` for displaying data in an organized and visually appealing manner.
* **`ListView.Builder`:** Building lists of items using `ListView.Builder`, focusing on optimal performance when dealing with a large number of items by only building the visible items.

**Overall Learning**

The "Workout Planner" project has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of several aspects of Flutter development. From mastering navigation patterns to working with external packages and adapting to different screen sizes, I have gained valuable experience that I will use in future projects.
